# Contributing to ModLink

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Feedback is tracked with Github's [issues](https://github.com/picret/modlink/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/picret/modlink/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Development

```bash
conda create -n modlink python=3.10

```
